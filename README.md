# Overview
Barebones Pomodoro timer with Win10 notifications.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, 
traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

You may modify the default timings by editing the variables shown in the code snippet below.

```
pom_work = 25 # mins
pom_rest_short = 5 # mins
pom_rest_long = 15 # mins
```
